                <h2>Hi! I'm Nawal Bhatti</h2>
                <!-- Source: (original work) Nawal Bhatti -->
                <p>I'm a sophomore studying Information Science with a minor in Business at Cornell University. My academic journey is geared towards delving into the realms of data science and software engineering, and I'm eager to explore these fields further. As a student, I bring a fresh perspective and a thirst for knowledge to the ever-evolving landscape of technology. I believe in the power of data to drive insights and the ability of well-crafted code to create impactful solutions. Join me on this journey as I navigate through the exciting intersection of information science and business, aiming to contribute meaningfully to the world of technology.</p>

                <!-- Source: (original work) Nawal Bhatti -->
                <p>I love to travel, especially in Europe, where I've explored many countries. Having family in Germany means I get to discover even more places. Traveling opens my eyes to different backgrounds and perspectives, making me more open-minded. I also have a passion for photography, and I've been taking pictures since I was little. I have taken many classes, and all the pictures you see as banners on each page of my portfolio were taken by me! Food is a big part of my adventures. I enjoy trying new restaurants, and I'm quite picky about my sushi. In my hometown, Columbia Maryland, there's this fantastic spot called Sushi Sono that I always go to, it's my go-to place for sushi!</p>
